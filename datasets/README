Data downloaded from here:

Need to register in order to download "ascii-all.tar.gz",
"lineStrokes-all.tar.gz", "trainset.txt", "testset_t.txt", "testset_f.txt",
and "testset_v.txt". Once done, the tar.gz files should be unzipped, revealing
directory structures "ascii" and "lineStrokes".

The ultimate train/valid splits for this dataset are taken from
"Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks", Alex Graves, 2013.
See section 4: Handwriting Prediction for a detailed breakdown. The directions
according to the paper indicate combining "trainset.txt", "testset_t.txt", and
"testset_f.txt" into one trianing set, while using "testset_v.txt" as valid.

This is reflected in the files "train.txt" and "valid.txt".
